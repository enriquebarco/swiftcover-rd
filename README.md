# SwiftCover

SwiftCover is a state of the art AI tool used to craft tailored cover letters that fit any job description within seconds. No more tedious editing and tweaking - let our AI do the work for you!

This project is currently generating revenues and has hundreds of users, therefore, to prevent malicious attacks and forks, I have made the repository private.

## How  it works...

Users are prompted to create an AI generated cover letter.

Once the AI has generated the cover letter, users can refine the cover letter or simply copy and paste
